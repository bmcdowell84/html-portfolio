<h1>Brian's Favorite Horror Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 horror movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Halloween (1978)</h3>
<p>It created the modern slasher we all love today.</p>

<h3>Friday the 13th (1980)</h3>
<p>Kicked off one of the best franchises of all time, and has a little twist for newbie watchers.</p>

<h3>Scream (1996)</h3>
<p>Another franchise favorite. It grounds slashers and shows it can happen anywhere, at any time.</p>
